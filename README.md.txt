# Fibonacci Smart PickerA mathematically weighted lottery number generator.The Fibonacci Smart Picker is a mobile-first web application designed to help users generate lottery picks based on natural sequences and statistical probability. Unlike standard random generators, this app applies two specific mathematical filters:The Fibonacci Filter: The generator ensures that at least two numbers in every ticket belong to the Fibonacci sequence ($1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55$).Odd/Even Balancing: Statistically, winning lottery draws rarely consist of all odd or all even numbers. This app re-rolls picks until it finds a balanced 3:3 ratio (3 odd numbers and 3 even numbers).## FeaturesHaptic Feedback: The app vibrates on Android devices when numbers are generated for a physical "machine" feel.Persistent History: Your last 5 generated tickets are saved locally on your device.PWA Ready: Can be "Installed" as a standalone app on your Android home screen.Native Sharing: Easily share your picks with friends using the built-in share button.## How to InstallOpen the live URL in Google Chrome on your Android device.Wait for the page to load.Tap the three dots (⋮) in the top right corner.Select "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen."## Technical DetailsFrontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScriptLogic: Fibonacci weighting and parity (odd/even) filteringStorage: Browser localStorage for persistent ticket historyPWA: Service Worker (sw.js) and Web Manifest (manifest.json) for Android installation
